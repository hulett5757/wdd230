        <p>
            The Home Depot website shows good repetition. It uses the same color of orange which is recognized as the Home Depot color in their main header, the logo, the headings
             and all their links. The tools shown on the website also have that consistent orange color. Using this repetition helps the consumer know they are at the Home Depot w
             website, and encourages the association of that color with their company. It is a very good way to make your brand recognizable

        <p>
           Smith and Edwards has great contrast in colors on their website. They have a black back ground that makes their logo with the colors of red, white, and blue stand out.
            It encourages the consumer to focus on the logo first.Their links are also white which contrast nicely with the black. This makes their links very legible and user 
            friendly. They have a bright red banner with white contrasting colors announcing their new store hours which contrast with the black color of the main page. 
            They have used contrast to make their page attractive and user friendly.

        <p>
            Lagoon has used proximity on their webite by keeping their Logo, menu, and explore link all on the main page. This helps the user know that the website they are on it Lagoon
            and the menu and link are associated with the park. They have made it convienent for the consumer to be able to access what they ney need to know about the park quickly.
