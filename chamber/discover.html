            <h2>Why Shop Local</h2>
            <!--Photo by Kayle-Kaupanger on Unsplash-->
            <img src="images/news.jpg" alt="Market with shoppers">
            <p>Local retailers employ people who live in the community, not only staff but other businesses such as architects, contractors, and accountants
               that will help their business thrive. They are more likely to carry goods that are locally produced. According to the American Independent 
               Business Alliance each dollar spent in a local store brings as much as $3.50 into the local economy.<br><br>
               Shopping local give the people in the community a chance to connect and get to know business owners and other people living in the area.<br><br>
               Shopping in the local area gives people the opportunity to help the environment by running errands on foot or bicycle. This also has the added
               benefit of helping them be healthier.<br><br>
               The last benefit to shopping local is how it makes the community thrive and have a unique look and feel all its own.<br><br>
               We encourage everyone to shop local.
